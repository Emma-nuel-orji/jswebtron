A crowded website is bad for business and thus, should be avoided.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, websites that are chock-full of information will take longer to load and this will leave visitors to your websites frustrated and annoyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION:<\/strong> While trying to make sure that your website isn&#8217;t overly crowded, you could make the mistake of not supplying enough information and leaving your website to look a little too bare. It has become a norm in website design for websites to look sparse, this may work if done properly. However, leaving a lot to the imagination of the visitors is a big oversight&nbsp; and is more likely to lose you customers than get you some. Visitors want to know what your business is about and how it could be of service to them. It is important for that information to be made clear in a simple and concise manner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A CONCEALED NAVIGATION MENU: <\/strong>Going to a website and finding it difficult to locate the navigation menu or the search bar is frustrating and really annoying, yet it is one of the most common mistakes in web development.
