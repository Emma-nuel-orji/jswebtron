Ensure that your posts look as simple and plain as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Walk away from \u2018Get Rich Quick\u2019 schemes<\/strong>: Don\u2019t make over exaggerated promises in your ad copies; \u2018<em>Make $10,000 in the next 30 days if you sign up now\u2019<\/em>, this type of caption will have your ad taken down in a matter of minutes so avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Sensitive topics<\/strong>: Do not build ads around topics such as health, weight loss, beauty products, anti-aging and the likes. These topics are seen as triggering in some ways and ads that take on these topics tend to be taken down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Profanity<\/strong>: Do not use curse words, slurs or any type of foul language in your ad copy. This tends to completely piss off and trigger the algorithm to do things to your ads you wouldn\u2019t like at all, so avoid them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Personal attributes<\/strong>: Do not overuse words such as \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018your\u2019 in your ad copy. Ads that do this tend to be taken down whenever the algorithm notices the frequent use of the words. Try to structure your ad to appeal to a certain group and make it really obvious with your use of words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Visit this marketing plan for ecommerce<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, these platforms tend to have a lot of rules that you might not be fully aware of, but it is still important to know as much as you can and implement them to fully reap the rewards of digital marketing.
